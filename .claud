# Claude Project Instructions

## Session Initialization

**IMPORTANT:** Before beginning work on this project or immediately after launching a session, you must:

1. **Review the Project Structure**
   - Locate and examine the `model.uml` file in the project root
   - This file contains the complete architectural overview and relationships between components
   - Use this as your primary reference for understanding the codebase organization

2. **Understanding model.uml**
   The `model.uml` file provides:
   - Class hierarchies and relationships
   - Module dependencies
   - Data flow between components
   - System architecture patterns
   - Key interfaces and their implementations

## Why This Matters

Reviewing `model.uml` first ensures:
- Consistent understanding of the project architecture across all sessions
- Proper context for any modifications or additions
- Awareness of existing patterns and conventions
- Prevention of architectural violations
- Better informed decisions about where to implement new features

## Session Checklist

- [ ] Located `model.uml` file
- [ ] Reviewed overall system architecture
- [ ] Identified main components and their relationships
- [ ] Understood data flow patterns
- [ ] Noted any specific architectural patterns or conventions

*This file serves as a persistent reminder for Claude to maintain architectural awareness throughout the development process.*
